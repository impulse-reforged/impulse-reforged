## impulse: reforged
impulse reforged is a free, open-source framework for Garry's Mod built upon the original impulse framework by vin. impulse is designed to be a lightweight, efficient, and secure framework for Garry's Mod servers. Alongside this, it's built with performance in mind, and is designed to be as efficient as possible.

## Security
Security is the backbone of impulse. Networking and client data handling has been carefully crafted to keep troublemakers at bay.

## Performance
impulse has been optimized to the bit for maximum performance. Servers can expect to achieve 128 players concurrently (given proper moderation and a well constructed schema) without major issues.
